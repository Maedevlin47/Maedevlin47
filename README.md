Hi 👋

<!--
**Maedevlin47/Maedevlin47** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a Software Engineer with 7 years of experience in start-up environments, currently working at an early-stage start-up, developing with JavaScript, React.js, Docker, PostgreSQL, SQL, Semantic UI, TailwindCSS, CSS, and HTML.

Having worked in both software engineering and business development/sales roles at start-ups ranging from 10 to 1,000 people, I possess valuable insights into user interactions and common challenges faced on platforms. With strong analytical skills and keen attention to detail, I excel at problem-solving and thrive in fast-paced, forward-thinking environments. Collaboration with colleagues and continuous learning are key drivers for me.
